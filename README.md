# CivilizedDuels

Mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1163

Experimental mod that allows players to play chess to the death in their browser.

## Code split

The code is separated into 3 basic sections.
- ValheimMods
  - The actual mod, using JVL.
- backend
  - Express server supporting websockets. I'm hosting it on a free Heroku instance.
- frontend
  - Vue project hosted on Netlify. Where you actually play chess.

I'll add some more details here in the near future.
